# Aespa-supernova-site-theme
This is a website I built to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, inspired by the girl group aespa and their "Supernova" era. It was one of my first solo projects, combining my web development learning with something I love. I was really satisfied with the final result, so I decided to share it!
